## To create a folder:
1. Create new File
2. In the file name you'll see: **neobytes/*input***
3. In *input* remember to put / behind the folder name. (Example: **prep/**)
4. Now type in the name of the file that goes into the folder. The whole name should look like this: **neobytes/prep/fileName**
